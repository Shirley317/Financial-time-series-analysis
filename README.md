# Financial-time-series-analysis
文件内包含三个金融时间序列分析的任务：利用线性模型ARIMA分析理论时间序列建模与预测（含ADF，PACF,ACF等一系列检验），周期性时间序列建模和预测（使用Seasonal ARIMA模型），模拟和分析ARCH和GARCH模型。  
注：可以借鉴方法和代码，但是很多细节做的比较粗糙。  
  
The document contains three tasks for financial time series analysis: modeling and forecasting theoretical time series using linear model ARIMA (including a series of tests such as ADF, PACF and ACF), modeling and forecasting of cyclical time series based on Seasonal ARIMA, and simulating and analyzing ARCH and GARCH models.  
Note: Methods and code can be taken, but many details are rough.
